" Time execution of vim command(s) with subsecond resolution,
" For example:
"      :TIM sleep 100m
" prnits
"      Execution took   0.100301 sec.
" With counter, TIMEIT times that many repetitions of the command:
"      :10TIM sleep 100m
" prints:
"      10 repetitions took   1.039352 sec.
" You can use sequence of |-separated commands under TIM:
"      :10TIM syntax off | syntax on
" This will time ten repetitions of (syntax off | syntax on)
" sequence, not 10 repetitions of "syntax off" followed by
" one untimes "syntax on".
